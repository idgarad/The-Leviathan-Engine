# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the major phases for building and evolving The Leviathan Engine. Each section includes objectives and key deliverables to guide development and infrastructure work.

## Infrastructure
- **Objective:** Establish foundational systems for code management, automation, and deployment.
- **Deliverables:**
	- Version control setup (GitLab/GitHub)
	- Containerization (Docker, Docker Compose)
	- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
	- Configuration management (Ansible)
	- Monitoring and observability (Prometheus, Grafana)

## Coding
- **Objective:** Develop core engine features and supporting modules in Go.
- **Deliverables:**
	- Engine architecture and main server implementation
	- Modular plugin system
	- Command processing and protocol handling

	- Comprehensive documentation and code comments

## Performance Testing
- **Objective:** Validate system scalability, reliability, and responsiveness under load.
- **Deliverables:**
	- Load testing scripts (k6, custom Go tools)
	- Automated regression and KPI tests
	- Metrics collection and reporting
	- Performance dashboards

## Benchmarking
- **Objective:** Establish baseline metrics and compare infrastructure and engine performance across environments.
- **Deliverables:**
	- Benchmark scenarios for world generation, player simulation, and NPC activity
	- Data import/export performance tests
	- Comparative analysis of datastore backends
	- Reporting and recommendations

## Content Pass
