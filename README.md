**The Leviathan Engine** is both a scalable text-based MUD/MMO engine and a comprehensive **Rust learning journey**. This project takes complete programming beginners through advanced systems programming concepts by building real, useful tools that eventually integrate into a complete game engine.

## 🎓 **Educational Mission**

**Target Audience**: Complete programming beginners OR experienced developers new to Rust  
**Learning Philosophy**: Master Rust by building practical administrative tools and game systems  
**Outcome**: Go from zero programming knowledge to building sophisticated distributed systems in ~1 year

- **Complete Game Engine** - All systems integrated and operational

## 🛠️ **Learning Approach**

### **Client Requirements Methodology**
The **[Codex Library](Docs/Codex/README.md)** serves as your **client requirements specification** - detailed technical and design documents that define exactly what needs to be built. This teaches essential professional skills:
- **Requirements Analysis**: Understanding complex, interconnected system specifications  
- **Technical Translation**: Converting business/design requirements into code architecture
- **Scope Management**: Building incrementally toward comprehensive system goals
- **Client Communication**: Learning to work from formal specification documents

### **Sidecar Projects + Engine Integration**
- **Sidecar Projects**: Small external projects for learning concepts (Phases 0-1)
- **Engine Integration**: Build components within the main project (Phases 2-3)  
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each sprint builds on previous knowledge while working toward Codex requirements
- **Practical Focus**: Every tool solves real administrative problems defined in the specifications

### **Educational Philosophy**
- **Zero Assumptions**: Complete beginner-friendly explanations with professional context
- **Requirements-Driven**: Learn to build what the client actually needs, not what seems interesting
- **Hands-On Learning**: Build working tools that meet real specifications, not toy examples
- **Professional Practices**: Testing, documentation, and version control from day one
- **Scope Management**: "Good enough to meet requirements" prevents feature creep
- **Resource Rich**: Books (with ISBNs), academic papers, videos, and online courses

## 🎮 **The Game: Space-Based Political Simulation**

### **Vision: "Game of Thrones in Space"**
A fusion of **Dwarf Fortress** depth, **Eve Online** political complexity, and **Europa Universalis** grand strategy mechanics. The Leviathan Engine creates a living political simulation where players are **Wardens** (ship commanders) serving **NPC Houses** in territorial expansion campaigns.

**"There are no windows in space"** - The interface philosophy emphasizes **radar displays, tactical terminals, and sensor data** rather than 3D space views. This is about **commanding a ship**, not flying a fighter jet - you give orders and receive reports through professional interfaces that someone at NASA would appreciate.

### **Core Concept**
Players never own territory directly - they earn **shares** and **influence** through contracts and military service in an ever-evolving political landscape. The game world remains engaging **even with zero players** - a dramatic ant farm of NPC political maneuvering, economic cycles, and territorial shifts.

### **Key Systems** *(What You'll Build - The Complete Specification)*
- **Bridge Operations**: Multi-device command interfaces with crew management and XO autonomy
- **Combat Systems**: Layered damage (deflector/shields/armor/hull), targeting mathematics, and electronic warfare
- **FTL Travel**: Intrinsic Field mechanics with spin-up, cooldown, heat accumulation, and interdiction
- **Economic Simulation**: Regional markets, order books, taxation layers, and supply chain complexity
- **Political Systems**: NPC-driven grand strategy with administrative impulses and faction management
- **Manufacturing**: Planetary facility construction (Factorio-style) with contract obligations and skimming opportunities
- **Cargo & Storage**: Calculated Storage system with containerization and capacity politics
- **Skill & Certification**: Complex progression trees with post-mastery bonuses and fleet-wide effects
- **Language System**: Dynamic naming with grammar templates and translation capabilities
- **Campaign Structure**: Seasonal territorial expansion with shares, dividends, and legacy persistence
- **Safeguarding Systems**: NPC sovereignty enforcement and Sacred Rule compliance

### **Design Philosophy**
- **Autonomous World**: Engaging simulation even at zero players - NPCs drive all major systems
- **Authentic Spacefaring**: "No windows in space" - radar, terminals, and sensor interfaces over 3D graphics
- **NASA-Grade Interfaces**: Functional, information-dense displays that prioritize data over eye candy
- **Universal Accessibility**: Voice command integration and screen reader support - playable via Alexa or similar devices
- **NPC Sovereignty**: Players are contractors, not rulers (prevents toxic power dynamics)
- **Deep Systems**: Inspired by the complexity and emergence of the greatest strategy games
- **Modular Architecture**: Unix-style tools connected via message bus
- **Educational Value**: Every system teaches programming and game design concepts
