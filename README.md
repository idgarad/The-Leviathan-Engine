**The Leviathan Engine** is both a scalable text-based MUD/MMO engine and a comprehensive **Rust learning journey**. This project takes complete programming beginners through advanced systems programming concepts by building real, useful tools that eventually integrate into a complete game engine.

## 🎓 **Educational Mission**

**Target Audience**: Complete programming beginners OR experienced developers new to Rust  
**Learning Philosophy**: Master Rust by building practical administrative tools and game systems  
**Outcome**: Go from zero programming knowledge to building sophisticated distributed systems in ~1 year

## 🚀 **Quick Start for Learners**

### **Ready to Learn Rust?**
1. **Start Here**: [`Docs/Tutorials/README.md`](Docs/Tutorials/README.md) - Complete learning pathway
2. **First Sprint**: [`Sprint 0A: Environment Setup`](Docs/Tutorials/Phase-0-Developer-Renaissance/Sprint-0A-Environment-Setup.md)
3. **Track Progress**: Use the tutorial navigation and progress checklist

### **Want to See the Vision?**
- **Game Design**: [`Docs/Codex/README.md`](Docs/Codex/README.md) - Complete game system documentation
- **Architecture**: [`CODING-ROADMAP.md`](CODING-ROADMAP.md) - Technical learning progression
- **Philosophy**: [`Docs/References/`](Docs/References/) - Educational approach and resources

## 🎯 **What You'll Build & Learn**

### **Phase 0: Developer Renaissance** *(Weeks 1-2)*
- **Rust Environment Setup** - Modern development toolchain
- **Basic Calculator** - Fundamental syntax, testing, and Git workflows
- **Learning Focus**: Development habits and Rust mental models

### **Phase 1: Administrative Toolkit** *(Months 1-3)*
- **Faction Config Generator** - Structs, enums, serialization, CLI tools
- **Ship Design Validator** - Advanced error handling, pattern matching, validation
- **NPC Behavior Simulator** - Collections, iterators, algorithms
- **Database Schema Migrator** - Traits, generics, database integration

### **Phase 2: Simulation Systems** *(Months 4-6)*
- **Economic Simulator** - Async programming, concurrent processing
- **Performance Profiler** - Benchmarking, optimization techniques  
- **Config Template Engine** - Macros, code generation
- **Integration Test Harness** - System testing, automation

### **Phase 3: Real-Time Engine** *(Months 7-9)*
- **Message Bus Foundation** - Network programming, distributed systems
- **Grid Manager Service** - Concurrent data structures, spatial systems
- **Real-Time Dashboard** - Web frameworks, WebSockets, live data
- **Complete Game Engine** - All systems integrated and operational

## �️ **Learning Approach**

### **Sidecar Projects + Engine Integration**
- **Sidecar Projects**: Small external projects for learning concepts (Phases 0-1)
- **Engine Integration**: Build components within the main project (Phases 2-3)
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each sprint builds on previous knowledge
- **Practical Focus**: Every tool solves real administrative problems

### **Educational Philosophy**
- **Zero Assumptions**: Complete beginner-friendly explanations
- **Hands-On Learning**: Build working tools, not toy examples  
- **Professional Practices**: Testing, documentation, and version control from day one
- **Scope Management**: "Good enough to learn the concept" prevents feature creep
- **Resource Rich**: Books (with ISBNs), academic papers, videos, and online courses

## 🎮 **The Game: Space-Based Political Simulation**

### **Core Concept**
A text-based MMO where players are **Wardens** (ship commanders) serving **NPC Houses** in territorial expansion campaigns. Players never own territory directly - they earn **shares** and **influence** through contracts and military service.

### **Key Systems** *(What You'll Build)*
- **Bridge Operations**: Multi-device command interfaces for capital ships
- **Economic Simulation**: Complex supply chains and manufacturing 
- **Political Intrigue**: House rivalries, espionage, and territorial control
- **Combat Systems**: Fleet battles with detailed damage modeling
- **Persistent Campaigns**: Seasonal content with long-term consequences

### **Design Philosophy**
- **NPC Sovereignty**: Players are contractors, not rulers (prevents toxic power dynamics)
- **Modular Architecture**: Unix-style tools connected via message bus
- **Educational Value**: Every system teaches programming and game design concepts
