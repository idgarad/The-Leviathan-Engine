Here’s the **final, consolidated Combat Codex**—a complete bridge document that unifies all of our discussions into one authoritative reference. It blends lore, mechanics, officer roles, certifications, tank layers, targeting, EW, rules of engagement, and performance considerations into a single cohesive framework.

# 📘 Final Unified Combat Codex

## 🌌 Lore Layer
- **Operators**: Remote commanders interfacing via Command Nodes.  
- **Ships**: Fully crewed, but only **bridge officers** are explicitly tracked.  
- **Bridge Crew**: XO, Tactical, Navigation, Engineering, Comms—treated as “meat modules” that provide buffs.  
- **Combat Feel**:  
  - No cockpit view—combat is experienced through sensors, radar, and comms.  
  - Lag and time dilation are diegetically explained as Command Node sync delays.  
  - Anxiety of “no windows in space”: blips on radar, cloaked ships, uncertain locks.  
- **Doctrine**: Combat is about issuing orders (“Approach pattern Zeta, orbit at 30 km, fire bays 3 and 6”), not micromanaging thrusters.

## ⚙️ Design Layer

### 1. Tank Layers
**Damage resolution order:**

1. **Deflector Shield (first layer)**  
   - Exploits angle of attack to deflect shots into glancing blows.  
   - Factors: module quality, officer skill, range, angle of attack.  
   - Successful deflection reduces damage (25–50%).  

2. **Absorption Shields (subsequent layers)**  
   - Convert incoming energy/kinetic into heat.  
   - Phased channels: if weapon matches phase, shield is bypassed.  
   - Cycle modulation creates vulnerability windows.  
   - Layered: 3 (frigates) → 20 (capitals).  
   - Vulnerable to high RoF (phase‑walking) and alpha strikes (thermal overload).  

3. **Exterior Armor**  
   - Absorbs kinetic, disperses energy heat.  
   - Velocity bleed reduces penetration.  

4. **Exterior Hull**  
   - Structural shell; breaches cause secondary effects.  

5. **Laminated Inner Hull (LIH)**  
   - Kevlar‑like weave protecting crew/habitat.  
   - Last line of defense; semi‑flexible to absorb shock.  

---

### 2. Targeting & Hit Chance
\[
P_{\text{hit}} = \frac{T}{T + \left(\frac{V_{\text{trans}}}{R}\right)^\alpha} \cdot S
\]

- \(T\): Weapon tracking speed.  
- \(V_{\text{trans}}\): Target transversal velocity.  
- \(R\): Range.  
- \(\alpha\): Curve shaping constant.  
- \(S\): Sensor lock factor (reduced for small ships).  

**Officer Modifiers**  
- Tactical: Buffs tracking, crit, accuracy.  
- Navigation: Increases evasive transversal.  
- Comms: Improves sensor lock stability.  
- XO: Reduces variance in RNG (crew discipline).  

---

### 3. Maneuvers & Dodge
- **Dodge ability**: Crew executes evasive maneuvers → reduces hit chance temporarily.  
- **Scaling**: Ship agility + Navigation skill + XO + Tactical synergy.  
- **Cooldown**: Prevents spam; costs energy/accuracy.  

---

### 4. Electronic Warfare (EW)
- **Jamming**: Reduces enemy sensor factor \(S\).  
- **Spoofing/Taunt**: Redirects enemy targeting AI.  
  \[
  P_{\text{taunt}} = \frac{E_{\text{jam}} \cdot (1 + B_{\text{crew}})}{E_{\text{jam}} + R_{\text{enemy}}}
  \]  
- **Counter‑ECM**: Enemy Comms Officer and certs resist spoof/jam.  
- **Side effects**: Taunting increases own sensor footprint.  

---

### 5. Officers as Buff Modules
- XO: Order execution speed, reduces lag penalties.  
- Tactical: Accuracy, crit, tracking.  
- Navigation: Dodge, transversal, maneuverability.  
- Engineering: Energy efficiency, repair, heat management.  
- Comms: Sensor lock, EW effectiveness.  

---

### 6. Skills & Certifications
- **Skills**: Rank 1–10; Rank 5 = Mastery; Ranks 6–10 = global bonuses.  
- **Certifications**: All three skills in suite ≥ 5 → unlocks cert.  
- **Enhancement Bonuses**: Certs improve global bonuses of member skills (e.g., +10% global damage, +2% range).  
- **Meta‑Certifications**: Require multiple certs; unlock doctrines, ships, fleet abilities.  
- **Faction Gating**: USO and navies/corporations gate access to skills/certs.  

---

### 7. Rules of Engagement (RoE) & Resolution
- **Ships are not bombs**: Built to fail safe, not explode.  
- **The Emperor’s Kiss (TEK)**: Fragile bridge sensor; if destroyed or thresholds met, triggers surrender.  
- **Distress Surrender Beacon (DSB)**:  
  - Activated automatically.  
  - Operator disconnected; XO issues surrender.  
  - Ship enters custody of **Imperial Recovery Services (IRS)**.  
- **Aggressor Rights**:  
  - Entitled to salvage share.  
  - May ransom crew (via Crew Ransom Insurance payouts).  
  - May forgo ransom and escort crew to station.  
- **IRS Role**:  
  - Processes salvage, crew, and insurance payouts.  
  - Takes a cut of salvage.  
  - Often handles cleanup after battles.  
- **Loot Handling**:  
  - Abstracted: delivered to fleet commander.  
  - IRS batch‑processes salvage asynchronously.  

---

### 8. Critical Strikes & Spoils of War
- **Critical Strikes**: Rare hits disable specific modules (weapons, engines, shields, life support).  
- **Module Thresholds**: If enough modules are destroyed (e.g., 50%), TEK triggers DSB even if hull intact.  
- **Spoils of War**:  
  - Ship surrenders but remains largely intact.  
  - Aggressors may capture ship as a prize.  
  - Creates tactical choice: brute force wreck vs. precision disable.  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Layer

### Damage Resolution Flow
1. Roll for **hit chance** (tracking vs transversal, sensor lock).  
2. If hit → check **Deflector Shield glancing blow**.  
3. If glancing → apply reduced damage, skip deeper layers.  
4. If not glancing → apply to **Absorption Shields** (phase check, heat absorption, blowout risk).  
5. If shields fail → apply to **Armor** (absorption %, velocity bleed).  
6. If armor fails → apply to **Exterior Hull** (structural integrity).  
7. If hull fails → apply to **LIH** (crew/system protection).  
8. Check **critical strike rolls** → disable modules.  
9. If TEK destroyed or thresholds met → trigger **DSB**.  

### Performance Model
- **Local layer** (skills, certs, officers): Cached, recompute only on change.  
- **Fleet layer** (auras, EW, taunts): Per‑tick recompute, optimized with spatial partitioning and delta updates.  
- **Tick layers**:  
  - Physics: 1–10 Hz.  
  - Combat: 5–10 Hz.  
  - Sensors: 1–2 Hz.  
  - Command: event‑driven.  
- **Time dilation**: If server load spikes, slow simulation globally—diegetically explained as Command Node sync delay.  

---

## 📚 Lore Hooks
- **Deflector chatter**: “XO reports we angled the deflector—enemy shot glanced off!”  
- **Shield cycling secrets**: Guarded by navies; espionage targets.  
- **Alpha strikes**: Risk catastrophic shield blowouts → “thermal flash” events.  
- **“Getting under their guns”**: Explained as turrets unable to track fast targets.  
- **“Hard to lock”**: Small ships flicker on sensors.  
- **Crew chatter**: Officers narrate successes/failures of dodges, taunts, locks.  
- **Faction doctrines**: Some emphasize brute force, others EW trickery.  
- **Spoils of war**: Captured ships become valuable prizes, reinforcing salvage/ransom economy.  
- **Operator role**: You’re not flying—you’re commanding.

✅ This **Final Unified Combat Codex** now integrates:  
- Tank layers (Deflector → Absorption Shields → Armor → Hull → LIH).  
- Targeting, transversal, dodge, EW, officers, certifications.  
- Rules of Engagement (TEK, DSB, IRS, ransom insurance, salvage law).  
- Critical strikes & spoils of war.  
- Performance considerations for massive fleet battles.  
- Lore justification for abstraction and diegetic lag.

This codex is now a **complete bridge document**: lore‑rich, technically explicit, and performance‑aware. It’s ready to serve as the foundation for engine coding and narrative integration.
