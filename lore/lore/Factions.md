# Factions: The Imperial Throne

> **Update Notice:** Accurate as of October 29, 2025. This page follows wiki and markdown standards for clarity and navigation.

The Empire is structured in a feudal-like hierarchy. At the highest level is **The Imperial Throne**, which consists of the Imperial Royal Family and their direct holdings and institutions. Collectively, these groups are referred to as the Imperial Throne.

---

## Tier 1: The Imperial Throne

- **[The Imperial Family](Imperial-Family.md)**
  - The Imperial Family and its self-appointed Emperor have absolute authority in the galaxy.
  - They are the primary shareholder in the IHC (Imperial Holdings Corporation).
  - Most major Houses are related in some way to the Imperial Family.
- **[Imperial Court](Imperial-Court.md)**
  - Judicial arm of the Empire. Courts are largely automated to preserve impartial law.
  - Judges approve or deny AI-driven decisions.
  - Corruption is rare; corporations often exploit the Imperial Court for profit.
- **[Imperial Holdings Corporation (IHC)](Imperial-Holdings-Corporation.md)**
  - Legal corporate entity; all Imperial assets are owned through the IHC.
  - Centuries of complex laws have made it a breeding ground for corruption and graft.
- **[The Enclave](Enclave.md)**
  - Authority on patronage, vassals, titles, and honors; manages Noble Houses' authority and executes the Emperor's decrees.
- **[Imperial War College](Imperial-War-College.md)**
  - Primary educational facility for the Imperial Forces.
- **[Imperial Survey Corps](Imperial-Survey-Corps.md)**
  - One of the oldest institutions; surveys the galaxy and builds initial infrastructure in uncharted space. Holds considerable sway with the Imperial Throne.
  - Service in the ISC is a badge of honor and is expected of most nobles and CEOs. Ties among service members are strong, sometimes stronger than loyalty to their own house.
- **[Imperial Exchange](Imperial-Exchange.md)**
  - Regulates corporations; established when the merchant class rose to power. An elite of elites work among the machinery. Often at odds with the Imperial Treasury Services.
- **[Imperial Treasury Services](Imperial-Treasury-Services.md)**
  - Collects tribute (the Empire doesn't directly tax its citizens) from houses annually. Regulates currency and is frequently abused as a political tool.
  - Corruption is surprisingly rare due to the sheer level of oversight.
- **[Parliament of the Emperor (POE)](Parliament-of-the-Emperor.md)**
  - Major houses and corporations own 'shares' granting votes; even players may gain shares through wealth and power. Handles general operation of the galaxy. Due to the scale, their power is limited to large-scale policies. Houses and corporations have more local authority than the POE. However, when the POE speaks, the galaxy listens.
- **[Throne Worlds](Throne-Worlds.md)**
  - The original 100 planets united by the Empire; considered the Empire's fiefdom. Major houses reside here, apart from their actual holdings. Governors and stewards of Throne Worlds hold immense power.
- **[House of the Elders](House-of-the-Elders.md)**
  - Organization of Imperial-recognized religions. Each religion sends one representative. Can veto the Emperor (unanimous vote) on acts against Noble Houses.
- **[Imperial Standards and Practices Institute](Imperial-Standards-and-Practices-Institute.md)**
  - Maintains legal requirements for Imperial infrastructure.
- **[Imperial Intelligence Services / The Black Citadel](Black-Citadel.md)**
  - Intelligence arm of the Empire, known as the Black Citadel due to its operational location in the Franklin Ross Building on [Cafad-6](cafad-6.md).
- **[The Commons Hall](The-Commons-Hall.md)**
  - The Commons Hall is the collective of members who reside or are in attendance of the Imperial Family at the palace. Not to be confused with the Imperial Court (the judiciary). The Commons Hall is the more traditional sense of 'those in attendance'. It is a gossip mill, informal intelligence network, and noble houses are constantly trying to get someone into the Commons Hall.
  - The name comes from the hallway outside the throne room called The Common Hall. Technically anyone living at the palace, including the Imperial Family, are part of the Commons Hall. They usually have an unofficial [Mayor of the Commons](Mayor-of-the-Commons.md) who by tradition isn't a royal and has the privilege of entering the throne room without appointment. There is no formal process, just someone always ends up in that role.

> These groups collectively form the 'Imperial Throne' and shape the governance, law, and power structure of the Empire.

## Tier 2: The 'Teth' - Major Houses and Corporations

- **[The Major Houses](Major-Houses.md)**
  - Titled vassals of the Imperial Throne.
  - Free to organize themselves as they see fit.
  - May control territory, fiefdoms assigned by the Imperial Throne.
  - Existence is at the discretion of the Imperial Family.
  - Theoretical max is 100, as they are required to live on one of the 100 Throne Worlds.
  - May raise armies and hold ships. All ships must be commanded by a special commander known as an Operator (the player).
  - Operators are hired as mercenaries from the 31 Clans and officially considered Privateers of the House they are contracted to.
- **[Imperial Shipyard](Imperial-Shipyard.md)**
  - Primary IP holder of many technologies licensed to various corporations. Sets standards and practices codified by the ISPI and USO.
- **[Union for Space Operations](Union-For-Space-Operations.md)**
  - In an ancient war, the USO ended the conflict by going on strike. The Empire saw its effectiveness and authorized the USO's existence.
  - Membership is required for all personnel who work outside a planet's atmosphere.
  - While technically loyal to the Empire, they have substantial power. All houses employ USO members for offworld ship duties.
  - The USO and other key corporations present game patch notes diegetically. For example, if we reduce the damage of a MK-6 Laser Turret by 20%, we present it as "Due to safety concerns and recommended manufacturer maintenance, new USO standards have been made resulting in a reduction of the MK-6 laser turret damage by 25%."
- **[Omni Mining Services](Omni-Mining-Services.md)**
  - Largest mining corporation specializing in debris field, planetary, and orbital mining technologies. Their power and influence rivals any house.
- **[The Mercenary Clans](Mercenary-Clans.md)**
  - To keep the empire stable, the Empire granted commissions to 31 mercenary Clans. To limit all-out war and keep noble house infighting in check, all ships, despite having their own captains and bridge crew, must take command from an Operator (the player). No matter how large a fleet a noble house can muster, they depend on the Clans to provide an operator. This complex web of checks and balances keeps tension between the Imperial Throne, houses, pirate clans, corporations, and cartels in check. For example, all FTL drives are locked so that without an operator, a ship cannot perform an FTL jump. The only exception is Imperial Forces. By locking down FTL, the Empire has leverage to keep Houses and Corporations in check.
- **[Interstellar Transport Networks Corp](Interstellar-Transport-Networks-Corporation.md)**
  - Primary shipping company of the Empire. Under Imperial Protection, they provide guaranteed delivery of material at substantial cost.
  - ITNC set the standard of [Storage Capacity Units](Storage-Capacity-Units.md) or SC for short. A complex equation determines by weight and volume how much 'space' something takes. They consider standard cargo hold service equipment, cargo hold size, weight regulations, stackability, etc. Usually around 1 SC per 12.6647 tons of cargo when looking at average weights.
- **[Compliance Industries](Compliance-Industries.md)**
  - Makers of the dreaded Pain Amplification Chamber used in the worst of crimes.
  - Lots of shady equipment.
  - Thought to be secretly owned by a royal.
  - Small, secretive, and feared.
  - Heavily involved with the Black Citadel.

## Faction Structure Overview

At a high level, factions include:

- **Corporations**
  - Businesses (Legitimate)
  - Associations (Professional, cultural, educational organizations)
  - Cartels (Criminal networks, usually allied with pirate clans)
  - Pirate Clans (unchartered Clans commanding their own ships)
- **Cultures**
  - Various cultures have emerged, e.g., "Imperial Citizens" and "Imperial Nobles".
  - Houses and faiths tend to form their own cultures.
  - Cultures increase tension; e.g., as fiefdoms change hands, a Breggon-majority planet may not take well to Sathians moving in.
- **Faiths**
  - Power struggles between legitimate faiths and cults.
  - Due to the scale of the galaxy, cults are constantly popping up.
- **Houses** (Major and Minor)
  - Titled vassals of the Empire, all vie for power and survival. Due to the size of the empire, tithe and tributes can mean the difference between billions starving and survival. One misstep could cost a house its very existence. Houses also have to deal with the constant threat from corporations.
