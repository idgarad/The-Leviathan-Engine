History is vague before the empire:

Before the empire a terrible war erupted. Little is know. It left a few habitable worlds in a small area of the galaxy. When the empire rose up it left behind a very grim and dark past. But now it is trying to walk back into the light, but the chains of human nature are tugging at it's feet.

The first 1000 years was the Empire rebuilding civilization. By the time of the game we are 5000 years into the empire roughly.
