## Introduction

The Leviathan Engine is set in a vast, persistent virtual galaxy where players, factions, and AI agents shape the fate of worlds, civilizations, and the flow of history. Inspired by the philosophy that an MMO is a hobby, not a game to be beaten, the narrative centers on emergent stories, player agency, and the interplay of lore-driven systems.

## Core Themes
- Exploration of unknown frontiers
- Political intrigue and factional conflict
- Technological advancement and discovery
- Survival, trade, and resource management
- The tension between order and chaos

## Setting Overview
- The galaxy is divided into sectors, systems, and regions, each with unique cultures, histories, and resources.
- Factions vie for control, influence, and survival, ranging from governments and corporations to underground syndicates and independent explorers.
- Ancient mysteries, lost technologies, and cosmic phenomena shape the backdrop for player-driven stories.

## Primary Narrative Structure

The Empire is reclaiming the galaxy through a series of Campaigns—seasonal content arcs. Each Campaign is mapped by the Imperial Survey Corps (ISC), which selects a territory (a group of solar systems within a sector) for play. Sectors provide thematic gameplay elements (e.g., meteor strikes, supernova interference) and can be revisited in future campaigns.

The ISC puts up 12 homeworlds for bid, allowing the great houses to participate. Not all houses are present every campaign. The Empire, houses, and corporations are headquartered in the Throne Worlds (Territory 0)—lore-only, never directly interacted with.

After settlement, the Empire triggers periodic events: demands for tribute, infrastructure, and more. The goal of each Campaign is to prepare the territory for the Imperial Throne. If a house does well they may be allowed to retain their claims in this new territory rather than transfer them to the Imperial Throne.

Following ancient wars, the United Space Operators (USO) union rose to power by striking and halting all ship docking. The Empire now uses the USO as a leash to control the houses. Mercenary Clans, chartered by the Empire, are hired by houses to command ships (Operators—players) remotely. However, houses require all ships to be crewed by humans, all USO union members, creating a power dynamic that keeps all factions in check.

Patch notes are made lore-friendly via the USO and other NPC institutions (e.g., "Due to safety concerns, new USO standards reduce laser turret damage by 25%").

All wreckage is property of the Imperial Salvage and Recovery Services (ISRS). Players may loot wreckage, but after a period, it becomes ISRS property (a lore-friendly cleanup system; mascot: Fido the bulldog).

Wars are structured and regulated by all parties. Mercenaries are the only effective tools for house conflict, functioning as chartered privateers. The Imperial War College maintains the registry for military ranks for Clan Operators. Ranks persist across contracts and campaigns, and houses comply with rank assignments.

Operators (players) must balance obligations to houses, avoid becoming threats, outcompete corporations, and maximize wealth and power during campaigns.

Beneath this, the mystery of the ancient wars and cosmic horror elements (inspired by Lovecraft, Warhammer 40k, Event Horizon) emerge. The universe is not grimdark, but a society emerging from dystopia, slowed by warlords, corrupt nobles, and cults lurking in the margins.

## Planetary Systems & ISC Survey Protocol

When the Imperial Survey Corps (ISC) surveys a territory, they only map and list "Economically Viable" star systems. This explains why, in a galaxy of trillions of stars, gameplay focuses on a manageable subset. Hostile or undocumented systems—such as those near black holes—may exist nearby, potentially harboring rebels or other unknown entities, but are not officially recognized in campaign play.

Every ISC-listed solar system contains at least one planet classified as hospitable. Any planet with a colony is required by the Imperial Engineering Co. and the College of Imperial Standards and Practices (CISP) to maintain a terrestrial space port (a ground-based facility for ship landings, akin to a space airport).

Planets and moons may also support orbital infrastructure, including space stations, shipyards, communication hubs, mining lasers, telescopes, and more. The CISP strictly regulates the number and type of orbital objects allowed by planet class:

- **Terra-class planets:** Maximum 4 space stations, up to 50,000 low orbit satellites
- **Gas giants:** Maximum 6 space stations, only planet class permitted to host shipyards (debris is de-orbited into the gas giant)
- **Moons and other bodies:** Infrastructure limits set by CISP standards

These regulations shape the strategic and economic landscape, influencing faction control, resource access, and the development of colonies and infrastructure throughout the galaxy.

Some cultures choose to live in massive arcologies—self-contained habitats—orbiting directly around a star rather than an explicit planet, exploiting an imperial loophole. These off-world arcologies are subject to far less regulation, making them attractive havens for cartels, smugglers, and other shadowy organizations. At the same time, they can serve as potential free ports for trade and diplomacy, provided one has the right connections or reputation to gain access.

## Campaign Contracts & Patronage System

At the start of each campaign, players sign their initial contract with a major house. This contract lasts for one-third of the campaign duration, allowing players to change their patronage twice during a campaign. When a new territory opens, only Open Contracts are available, with no restrictions on participation.

As the campaign progresses, players gain opportunities to accept missions from various groups and participate in house-sponsored activities. When the time comes to renew a contract, players can choose from a wider array of potentially more lucrative contracts offered by other major houses, minor houses, or corporations. Strategic choices abound: a player might sign with a minor house to help dethrone a rival, or take a corporate contract to avoid clan rivalry and shift the political landscape.

This dynamic contract system encourages shifting allegiances, emergent rivalries, and evolving opportunities throughout each campaign, ensuring that player agency and strategic decision-making remain central to the experience.

## ISC Mapping Hierarchy & Fiefdom Dynamics

As the Imperial Survey Corps (ISC) explores new territories, they map the galaxy using a hierarchical structure:

- **Galaxy** → **Sectors** → **Territories** → **Regions** → **Arrays** → **Solar Systems**

Arrays are considered fiefdoms by the ISC and the Imperial Throne. When noble houses settle, they are granted a Sovereign Array—an array that cannot be revoked. The administration of an array is called a Stewardship, and each solar system within an array is managed by a Governor appointed by the house.

Houses often offer governorships to Clans within their array, and particularly powerful Clans may even be granted stewardship over an entire array. However, houses must petition the Imperial Throne for claim rights to arrays. The Throne may grant arrays to rival houses, insist on the installation of specific governors, or declare certain systems or arrays as 'Contested.'

A Contested array is open for any group strong enough to lay claim, providing opportunities for minor houses to seize power and for major houses to expand their influence. Many major houses rose to prominence by exploiting such opportunities. Since only houses can hold fiefdoms, corporations operate in the background, seeking advantages as houses struggle for new territory and influence.

There are 31 chartered clans that players may join. These clans compete fiercely for influence, contracts, and territory, and experience infighting and rivalry much like the noble houses themselves. Clan dynamics add another layer of intrigue and opportunity to the campaign landscape.
