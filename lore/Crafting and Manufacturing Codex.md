Perfect‚Äîlet‚Äôs add that as a formal **Addendum** to the **Crafting & Manufacturing Codex**, since it ties directly into persistence, campaign resets, and factional gating. Here‚Äôs the updated, finalized version with the addendum included:

# üìò Crafting & Manufacturing Codex (Final with Addendum)

## üåå Lore Layer
- **Automated Industry**  
  - 99% of all manufacturing is performed by **automated construction factories**, each specialized in a given industry (Ammo Forges, Shipyards, Module Fabs, etc.).  
  - Factories are **client‚Äëagnostic in execution**: a valid **ATEC (Advanced Technology Encrypted Codex)** is all that matters.  
  - However, factories **log the submitting Operator‚Äôs identity** for taxation, auditing, and Imperial oversight.  

- **ATEC as the Key**  
  - Each ATEC contains:  
    - Material manifest (raw resources).  
    - Human labor roles (oversight, QA).  
    - Timetables (production duration).  
    - Energy requirements.  
  - Installing an ATEC is like slotting in a cartridge: the factory runs the job automatically.  

- **Political Consequences**  
  - Operators may manufacture rival corporate products in a House‚Äôs territory.  
  - This is **legal under Imperial law**, but provocative‚ÄîHouses cannot block it, though they may retaliate politically or militarily.  
  - Savvy Operators may relocate production to neutral or pirate space to avoid inflaming tensions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Manufacturing Mechanics

### Factory Operation
- **Input**: ATEC + resources + energy + minimal crew.  
- **Process**: Automated assembly line executes encrypted instructions.  
- **Output**: Finished product (ammo, ships, modules, etc.).  
- **Logging**: Operator ID, ATEC ID, and jurisdiction recorded in factory logs.  

### Player Interaction
- **Configurable Options**:  
  - Operators can adjust production parameters when submitting an ATEC job.  
  - Skills and certifications reduce:  
    - Material usage (efficiency).  
    - Production time (optimization).  
    - Energy costs (engineering).  
- **Gameplay Loop**:  
  - Acquire ATEC ‚Üí Secure resources ‚Üí Choose factory location ‚Üí Configure job ‚Üí Submit ‚Üí Collect product.  
  - Entire careers can be built around manufacturing without ever flying a ship.

## üí∞ Economics & Taxes
- **Tax Layers**:  
  - **Imperial Tax**: Always applied.  
  - **House Tax**: Levied by the House steward of the Array.  
  - **Governor Tax**: Local system governors may add levies.  
- **Standing & Margins**:  
  - Good standing = lower taxes, priority access.  
  - Poor standing = higher taxes, restricted access.  
- **Political Geography**:  
  - Manufacturing in a rival House‚Äôs territory is legal but logged.  
  - Logs can be used as evidence of disloyalty, espionage, or provocation.

## üöÄ Bootstrapping Player Economies
- **Early Campaign Challenge**: At campaign start, the economy is fragile‚Äîfew ATECs are in circulation, and players lack infrastructure.  
- **Bootstrap Strategies**:  
  - **Seeded ATECs**: Empire or Corporations may release a baseline set of Blue‚Äëtier ATECs to ensure basic production (ammo, fuel, hull repairs).  
  - **Imperial Subsidies**: Temporary tax reductions or grants to incentivize early manufacturing.  
  - **Starter Contracts**: Corporations and Houses issue guaranteed contracts to Operators to kickstart industrial activity.  
  - **Progressive Unlocks**: Higher‚Äëtier ATECs (Green/Red) enter circulation as campaigns mature, ensuring a staged economic ramp.  
- **Narrative Justification**:  
  - The Empire and Corporations deliberately ‚Äúprime the pump‚Äù to stabilize new territories.  
  - Operators are incentivized to establish industrial bases quickly, ensuring Houses can wage their wars and the Empire collects its taxes.

## ‚ûï Addendum: ATEC Persistence Across Campaigns
- **Carryover Rule**:  
  - Operators may bring their existing ATECs from one campaign into the next.  
  - This preserves long‚Äëterm investment and creates continuity across campaigns.  
- **Factory Gating**:  
  - Even if an Operator holds an ATEC, they may not be able to use it immediately.  
  - Production requires the necessary factories to be operational in the new territory.  
  - Access to factories may be **gated by faction standings** (Empire, Houses, Corporations).  
- **Strategic Implications**:  
  - Veteran Operators enter campaigns with an advantage in ATEC libraries, but must still navigate political and logistical hurdles.  
  - Early campaigns may see Operators waiting for infrastructure to catch up before they can leverage their full industrial potential.  
- **Lore Justification**:  
  - The Empire allows ATECs to persist as part of the clans‚Äô mercenary rights.  
  - However, new territories are ‚Äúfrontier economies‚Äù‚Äîfactories must be built, staffed, and sanctioned before production can begin.

## üìö Lore Hooks
- **‚ÄúFactories don‚Äôt care what you build, but everyone else does.‚Äù**  
- **Smuggler‚Äôs Edge**: Pirate factories ignore logs and taxes, but risk raids and poor quality control.  
- **Corporate Rivalry**: Corporations compete to sell ATECs, but rely on clans to actually produce.  
- **Imperial Pragmatism**: The Empire tolerates corporate dominance because taxes flow upward regardless.  
- **Bootstrap Narratives**: Early campaigns are remembered for their ‚Äúlean years,‚Äù when Operators scrambled to establish the first industrial chains.  
- **Persistence Drama**: Veteran Operators arriving with rare ATECs can destabilize early economies, forcing Houses and Corporations to react.

‚úÖ This **final Crafting & Manufacturing Codex** now includes:  
- Automated, logged factory operations.  
- ATEC as the universal manufacturing key.  
- Player‚Äëdriven manufacturing loop with skill‚Äëbased optimization.  
- Taxation layers and political consequences.  
- Bootstrapping strategies for early campaign economies.  
- **Addendum on ATEC persistence across campaigns**, with factory gating and faction standing requirements.

Would you like me to **draft the Jurisdiction & Taxation Codex next** (Arrays, Stewards, Governors, and how their tax layers interact with Imperial law and faction standings), since that‚Äôs the natural extension of this economic framework?
