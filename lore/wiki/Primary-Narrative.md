# Primary Narrative

> **Update Notice:** Accurate as of October 29, 2025. This page summarizes the core story, world context, and foundational principles.

## World Context
- The Leviathan universe is governed by the USO and Imperial Throne, enforcing strict safety, engineering, and social protocols.
- Ships are designed for survivability, not cinematic drama; all visual feedback is via sensors and tactical overlays.
- The absence of windows, double hulls, and modular construction reflect the realities of space travel and USO mandates.
- FTL travel, territory control, and faction politics drive the main narrative arcs.

## Survival & Ransom
- Crew remain with disabled ships; distress beacons are respected by all factions.
- Aggressors may exercise the Right to Ransom, with rates set by the Imperial Throne and paid by USO insurance.
- Pirate factions emerged as a direct result of formal ransom policies.

## Faction Dynamics
- Players interact with houses, clans, and corporations via contracts, reputation, and consequences of actions.
- Reputation and standing are central to progression and narrative outcomes.
