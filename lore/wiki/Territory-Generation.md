# Territory Generation

> **Update Notice:** Accurate as of October 29, 2025. This page documents the structure, rules, and lore for territory creation and campaign play.

## Hierarchical Structure
- Galaxy > Sectors > Territories > Regions > Arrays (fiefdoms) > Solar Systems > Planets & Moons

## Star Gate & Wormhole Networks
- Star gates are constructed in pairs, enabling J-Space travel via Quantum Shadow Map (QSM).
- Wormhole space is navigated via semi-organic gates stabilizing W-Space; navigation and comms function as in normal space.

## Campaign & Faction Rules
- Houses, clans, and corporations vie for control via contracts, reputation, and strategic play.
- Survival protocols, distress beacons, and ransom policies are enforced across all territory.

## Generation Guidelines
- Lore consistency, gameplay variety, and technical feasibility are prioritized.
- See [[Primary-Narrative]] and [[Design-Philosophy]] for foundational principles.
