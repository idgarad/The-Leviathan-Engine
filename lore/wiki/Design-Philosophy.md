# Design Philosophy

> **Update Notice:** Accurate as of October 29, 2025. This page centralizes all core design principles for The Leviathan Engine.

## Core Principles
- **No windows in space ships:** All visual feedback is via sensors, tactical overlays, or camera feeds. USO mandates double hull design, making windows structurally impossible and tactically unsound.
- **Safety, modularity, and redundancy:** Ship design prioritizes survivability, compartmentalization, and rapid repair.
- **Sensor-driven gameplay:** Player experience is tactical and abstracted, not cinematic or graphical.
- **Survival protocols:** Crew remain with disabled ships; distress beacons are respected by all factions per USO law.
- **Right to Ransom:** Aggressors may ransom survivors; rates set by the Imperial Throne, paid by USO insurance. Officers require personal policies; players pay premiums as a game mechanic.
- **Faction reputation:** Player actions affect standing with factions, clans, and corporations.
- **Engine simplification:** Lore is designed to support scalable, performant game engine logic (e.g., batch event processing, cooldown mechanics).

## Application
- All lore, gameplay, and engine features must align with these principles.
- Update this page as new design philosophies are adopted.
