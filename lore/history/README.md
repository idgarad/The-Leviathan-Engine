- Ships do not eject escape pods; crew remain with disabled ships for safety and local gravity.
- Distress beacons are activated by ship mainframes upon disablement, and all factions respect these signals per USO law.
- Players interact with factions, clans, and corporations via NPCs, contracts, and consequences of actions. Reputation is affected by player choices.
# Primary Narrative & World Design Principles

> **Update Notice:** Accurate as of October 29, 2025. For latest lore and narrative, consult this document and related lore files.

## Core Design Principle: There are no windows in space ships
- All visual feedback is via sensor data, tactical overlays, or camera feeds (internal or drone-based).
- No real-time graphics; all player views are abstracted, tactical, or sensor-driven.
- USO (United Systems Organization) mandates double hull design for all spacecraft, making windows structurally impossible and tactically unsound.

## Narrative Context
- The absence of windows is a direct result of safety, tactical, and regulatory requirements in the Leviathan universe.
- Players experience the world through advanced sensors, tactical displays, and remote camera feeds, reinforcing immersion and realism.
