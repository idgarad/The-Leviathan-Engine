That’s a fantastic refinement. You’re essentially introducing **two layers of progression beyond mastery**:

1. **Post‑Mastery Bonuses** (per skill):  
   - Every skill in a suite (Baseline, Efficiency, Efficacy) continues to give *small diminishing returns* after Rank 5.  
   - In addition, each skill unlocks a **generalized bonus track** (e.g., repair cost reduction, maintenance savings, training speed, etc.).  

2. **Suite Certification** (meta‑bonus):  
   - If a player has **all three skills in a suite at Rank 5 or higher**, they earn a **Certification**.  
   - Certifications act as **gates** for advanced ships, doctrines, or even unlocking new skill suites.  
   - This makes progression feel meaningful and structured, while also giving you a lore‑friendly way to gate advanced content.

# 📘 Player Skills Codex (Finalized with Certifications)

## 🌌 Core Principles
- **Ranks 1–10**: XP‑purchased, with Rank 5 = Mastery.  
- **Post‑Mastery (6–10)**: Diminishing returns on core effect + new generalized bonuses.  
- **Certifications**: Awarded when all three skills in a suite reach Rank 5+.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Example (Python)

```python
def skill_effect(rank, mastery_point=5, core_mod=0.02, post_mod=0.005, general_bonus=None):
    """
    rank: current skill rank (1-10)
    mastery_point: rank where core effect caps
    core_mod: per-rank bonus before mastery
    post_mod: per-rank bonus after mastery (diminishing)
    general_bonus: dict of {effect: value} unlocked after mastery
    """
    if rank <= mastery_point:
        core_effect = rank * core_mod
        general_effects = {}
    else:
        core_effect = mastery_point * core_mod + (rank - mastery_point) * post_mod
        general_effects = {k: (rank - mastery_point) * v for k, v in (general_bonus or {}).items()}
    return core_effect, general_effects

def suite_certification(skill_ranks, mastery_point=5):
    """
    skill_ranks: dict of {skill_name: rank}
    Returns True if all skills are >= mastery_point
    """
    return all(r >= mastery_point for r in skill_ranks.values())

# Example usage
skills = {
    "Laser Weapon Operations": 6,
    "Laser Modulation": 5,
    "Integrated Laser Operations": 7
}
print("Certification Achieved:", suite_certification(skills))
```

## 📚 Lore Hooks
- **Certifications** are recognized by academies, guilds, and factions.  
- They act as **licenses** to operate advanced ships or doctrines.  
- Some ships may require multiple certifications (e.g., “Laser Weapons Specialist” + “FTL Navigator”).  
- Certifications can also unlock **meta‑skills** (e.g., “Fleet Command” requires Gunnery + Navigation + Logistics certifications).  

---

✅ With this structure, every skill has **post‑mastery progression**, and every suite has a **Certification milestone** that ties directly into unlocking ships, doctrines, and advanced skill trees.  

Would you like me to **expand the 10 suites we built earlier** so that each one has its **post‑mastery bonuses and certification defined**, turning the codex into a complete reference?
