Here’s the **finalized and fully regenerated Sovereignty & Territory Codex**, integrating everything we’ve discussed: Imperial ownership, seasonal campaigns, sector structure, economic resets via ISC gates, sovereignty by proxy, shares and dividends, legacy metadata, and the persistence layer. This is the authoritative version you can treat as a reference document.

# 📘 Sovereignty & Territory Codex (Final)

## 🌌 Lore Layer
- **Imperial Mandate**  
  - All space belongs to the Empire. Houses, Corporations, and Clans do not own territory outright—they hold it in **fiefdom** or **charter**, granted by Imperial authority.  
  - Campaigns are the Empire’s mechanism for expanding into new **Territories** within larger **Sectors** of the galaxy.  

- **Sectors & Territories**  
  - **Sectors** are lore containers: each Sector may host multiple campaigns over time, each with unique rules and conditions.  
  - **Territories** are the specific star clusters (3,000–8,000 systems) contested during a campaign.  
  - Once a campaign concludes, the Territory is considered “settled” and is normally not revisited in gameplay, but it remains in the lore.  

- **Seasonal Content**  
  - Each campaign represents a **season of conquest and colonization**.  
  - If Houses perform well, they may retain holdings as permanent **fiefdoms** when the Territory is absorbed into the Empire.  
  - Poor performance means losing claims, with the Empire redistributing systems to more loyal or effective Houses.

## ⚔️ Sovereignty Mechanics
- **Layers of Control**  
  1. **Imperial Sovereignty**: The Empire is the ultimate owner of all space.  
  2. **House Stewardship**: Houses are granted Arrays (clusters of systems) to manage.  
  3. **Governor Authority**: Governors administer individual systems within an Array.  
  4. **Operator Presence**: Operators enforce sovereignty through fleets, industry, and contracts.  

- **Contesting Territory**  
  - The Empire may declare Arrays or systems “contested,” opening them to conquest.  
  - Sovereignty requires **continuous Operator presence**—fleets, industry, or infrastructure.  
  - Inactivity leads to decay, reverting systems to contested status.  

- **Campaign Outcomes**  
  - **Retention**: Houses that perform well retain holdings as permanent fiefdoms.  
  - **Redistribution**: Underperforming Houses lose claims; the Empire reallocates systems.  
  - **Imperial Favor**: Exceptional loyalty or service may earn Houses additional holdings.

## 🔄 Economic Reset & Imperial Eye Stargates
- **Initial ISC Stargates**  
  - At campaign start, the **Imperial Survey Corps (ISC)** provides temporary stargates with **very low mass throughput**.  
  - These gates cannot move vast resources or fleets, forcing Houses and Corporations to **bootstrap the economy with local resources**.  

- **Bootstrapping Phase**  
  - Operators must establish mining, refining, and manufacturing chains within the Territory.  
  - Early scarcity drives conflict, smuggling, and opportunism.  

- **Imperial Expectation**  
  - The Throne expects Houses and Corporations to **develop the Territory** while the ISC constructs the permanent **Imperial Eye Stargate**.  
  - This is both a test of loyalty and a practical necessity.  

- **Campaign Conclusion**  
  - When the **Imperial Eye Stargate** is completed, the Territory is fully integrated into the Empire.  
  - The campaign ends, sovereignty outcomes are locked, and the economy resets for the next expansion.

## 🛡️ Player Sovereignty by Proxy
- **NPC Sovereignty at the Top**  
  - Sovereignty is always vested in NPC organizations: the Empire, Houses, and Corporations.  
  - Players cannot claim sovereignty directly; they act as **proxies** through contracts and missions.  

- **Ad Hoc Houses**  
  - Large clans or alliances working under a House’s service may function as **informal, lesser Houses** (term TBD).  
  - These groups can be granted governorships or contracts but remain under the umbrella of a greater NPC House.  

- **Shares & Dividends**  
  - Completing contracts (e.g., building a stargate) issues **shares** to participants.  
  - Shares pay **dividends** until a specified term, which may span multiple campaigns.  
  - Even if sovereignty changes, the **Imperial Throne guarantees payouts**.  
  - Shares may be tapped for fines, insurance, or fees without flooding new economies with capital.  

- **Example**  
  - House Bakken is granted the NX2113O‑X Array, renaming it the **Mercedes Array**.  
  - The **Langer Coalition** (9 Operators) govern the system XN‑012AV, naming it **The Blue Cradle System**.  
  - They build its stargate, earning shares.  
  - Two months later, House Dremer takes the Array. The Langer Coalition loses governorship but continues to receive dividends from their shares.

## ♾️ Persistence Layer
- **Permanent Presence**  
  - Concluded Territories remain in lore, providing **ongoing income, bonuses, and prestige** to their controlling factions.  
- **Narrative Continuity**  
  - Political outcomes, clan reputations, and House histories persist across campaigns.  
- **Parallel Campaigns**  
  - Multiple campaigns may run simultaneously in different Sectors.  
  - Players may commit to one campaign at a time, ensuring narrative weight.  

---

## 🏛️ Legacy Metadata & Political Memory
- **Permanent Records**  
  - Every contract, construction, and governorship is logged in Imperial archives.  
  - Names of clans, Operators, and Houses are etched into the metadata of stargates, stations, and systems.  

- **Naming Rights**  
  - Names given to Arrays and systems persist, even if sovereignty changes.  
  - Imperial law forbids erasure without sanction.  

- **Political Consequences**  
  - Rival Houses may inherit fiefdoms littered with reminders of their enemies’ past triumphs.  
  - This fuels **long‑term grudges** and bitter rivalries.  
  - Shares and metadata force current rulers to pay tribute to rivals, deepening resentment.  

---

## 📚 Lore Hooks
- **“Governorship is fleeting, but the archives are eternal.”**  
- **The Mocking Gate**: A stargate built by a rival clan, still bearing their crest, now sits at the heart of a House’s fiefdom.  
- **The Bitter Array**: An Array whose metadata is dominated by a rival House’s legacy, sparking centuries of resentment.  
- **Clan Pride**: Clans boast of their names etched into Imperial records, even if they no longer hold the territory.

Would you like me to **draft the Campaign Lifecycle Codex next**, mapping out the phases (Survey → Bootstrap → Conflict → Imperial Eye Completion → Persistence) so we have a clear seasonal arc for both gameplay and lore?
