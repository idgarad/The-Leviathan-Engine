## Step 1: Plan Your MinIO Deployment

**Tool Explanation:**
MinIO is an open-source, S3-compatible object storage server. It is ideal for storing Terraform state, backups, and other files in a homelab. Multi-node, multi-disk setups provide redundancy and simulate production-grade reliability.

**Role in Infrastructure:**
MinIO acts as the backend for Terraform state and other persistent data, ensuring high availability and easy backup/restore.

## Step 2: Prepare VMs and Disks

1. Create two VMs (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) in Proxmox or your virtualization platform.
2. Attach two additional virtual disks to each VM (for MinIO data storage).
3. Assign static IPs for easy cluster setup (e.g., 192.168.1.101 and 192.168.1.102).
4. Ensure VMs can communicate over the network (same subnet).

> **Teaching Note:** Using separate VMs and disks simulates real-world MinIO clusters and provides fault tolerance.

---

## Step 3: Install MinIO on Each Node

1. SSH into each VM and install MinIO:
   ```bash
   wget https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio
   chmod +x minio
   sudo mv minio /usr/local/bin/
   minio --version
   ```
2. Create directories for each disk (e.g., `/mnt/disk1`, `/mnt/disk2`). Mount the disks and ensure proper permissions.

---

## Step 4: Configure and Start MinIO Cluster

1. On each node, start MinIO with the following command (adjust IPs and disk paths):
   ```bash
   export MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin
   export MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=yoursecurepassword
   minio server \
     http://192.168.1.101/mnt/disk1 http://192.168.1.101/mnt/disk2 \
     http://192.168.1.102/mnt/disk1 http://192.168.1.102/mnt/disk2 \
     --console-address ":9001"
   ```
2. Repeat on both nodes. MinIO will automatically form a distributed cluster.
3. Access the web console at `http://<node-ip>:9001` (login with credentials above).

> **Teaching Note:** Always use strong passwords and restrict network access to trusted hosts.

---

## Step 5: Create Buckets for Terraform State

1. Log in to the MinIO web console.
2. Create a bucket named `terraform-state` (or similar).
3. Note the endpoint URL, access key, and secret key for Terraform backend configuration.

---

## Step 6: Backup and Maintenance

- Regularly back up MinIO data directories to another disk or cloud service.
- Monitor cluster health via the web console.
- Test failover by shutting down one node and verifying access from the other.

---

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

- Use RAID or ZFS for additional disk redundancy if desired.
- Keep MinIO updated for security and stability.
- Document all configuration and credentials.
- Use firewall rules to restrict access to MinIO ports.
