# Multi-Node Docker Setup Tips & Tricks

> **Update Notice:** Instructions accurate as of October 28, 2025. For latest best practices, always consult official Docker documentation and community resources.

## Overview
This guide provides practical tips for setting up and managing multi-node Docker environments, especially in Proxmox clusters or similar virtualized infrastructure. Use this as a living referenceâ€”add new tips as you discover them!

## Key Steps for Multi-Node Docker Environments

### 1. VM Preparation
- Ensure each VM has:
  - Sufficient CPU, RAM, and disk space for expected container workloads
  - Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (or preferred Linux distro)
  - Static or DHCP-reserved IP addresses for reliable networking
  - SSH access for orchestration and troubleshooting

### 2. Docker & Docker Compose Installation
- Install Docker and Docker Compose on each node using official instructions
- Validate installation with `docker --version` and `docker compose version`
- Add your user to the `docker` group for passwordless operation

### 3. Networking & Discovery
- Use a dedicated Docker network (overlay or bridge) for inter-node communication
- For multi-host networking, consider Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for service discovery and orchestration
- Ensure firewall rules allow traffic between nodes on required ports (e.g., 2377, 7946, 4789 for Swarm)

### 4. Orchestration
- For simple setups, Docker Compose can be used with manual deployment on each node
- For advanced orchestration, use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes:
  - **Swarm:** Built-in clustering, easy to set up, good for small/medium clusters
  - **Kubernetes:** Enterprise-grade, more complex, best for large-scale or production

### 5. Storage & Volumes
- Use shared storage (NFS, GlusterFS, Ceph) for persistent volumes across nodes
- Ensure volume paths are consistent and accessible from all nodes

### 6. Monitoring & Logging
- Deploy monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, cAdvisor) on each node
- Centralize logs using ELK stack, Loki, or similar solutions

### 7. Security
- Keep Docker and OS packages up to date
- Use TLS for Docker API communication between nodes
- Limit container privileges and use resource constraints

### 8. Backup & Recovery
- Regularly back up container data and configuration
- Document recovery procedures for node or cluster failures
