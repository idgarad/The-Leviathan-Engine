## Overview
This document outlines expectations for the player tutorial system in The Leviathan Engine. The tutorial will be developed after core engine features are implemented and will be modular to support different campaigns, factions, and player types.

## Tutorial System Goals
- Teach basic controls and navigation
- Introduce core gameplay systems (contracts, missions, economy, reputation)
- Explain campaign structure and lore context
- Guide players through initial choices (faction, contract, exploration)
- Provide safety and risk awareness (zones, hazards, wormhole space)
- Support replayable and adaptive tutorials for new and returning players

## Modular Tutorial Design
- Tutorials will be managed as modules, allowing:
  - Multiple intro scenarios (by campaign, faction, or player choice)
  - Custom onboarding for advanced or returning players
  - Integration with dynamic events and campaign phases
- Tutorials may be updated or expanded as new features and lore are added

## Content Expectations
- Step-by-step guidance for:
  - Movement and navigation
  - Communication systems
  - Contract and mission mechanics
  - Economy basics (ATEC licenses, trading)
  - Faction and reputation systems
  - Safety protocols and risk zones
  - Crime and punishment mechanics (contraband detection, fines, KOS orders)
  - Economic and political systems (tax rates, mining rights, corporate/house/empire interactions)
- Interactive elements (NPC guides, tooltips, event triggers)
- Feedback collection for continuous improvement

## Development Notes
- Tutorial implementation will begin after core engine, world generation, and campaign systems are stable
- Early versions may be text-based or minimal; later versions will include interactive and adaptive content
- Documentation and tutorial modules must remain in sync with engine features and lore
