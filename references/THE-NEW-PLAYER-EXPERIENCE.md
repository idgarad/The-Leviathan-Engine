## Overview
This document outlines the initial experience for new players entering The Leviathan Engine universe. The new player experience is designed to be modular, allowing for future expansion and alternate introductions based on player choice, campaign, or faction.

## Initial Placement
- New players are placed in a designated starting system, typically a major house's homeworld or a neutral array during the Beachhead phase.
- The starting system must have:
  - A space port for onboarding
  - Access to basic missions and contracts
  - A gas giant (for shipyard infrastructure)
  - Safe zones for orientation and learning
  - NPC guides or tutorial agents

## Onboarding Expectations
- Players receive a brief narrative introduction to the campaign, factions, and their role as an Operator.
- Tutorial missions introduce:
  - Movement and navigation
  - Ship management and piloting
  - Docking and landing on planets
  - Navigating space station menus
  - Buying, selling, and trading
  - Accepting and managing contracts
  - Intelligence operations (spy craft)
  - Crime and punishment mechanics
  - Communication systems
  - Contract and mission mechanics
  - Economy basics (ATEC licenses, trading)
  - Faction and reputation systems
  - Safety protocols and risk zones
- Players are guided through their first contract selection (Open Contract or house-sponsored).
- Early gameplay is focused on exploration, learning, and low-risk activities.

## Modular Intro System
- The new player experience is managed as a module, allowing for:
  - Multiple intro scenarios (by campaign, faction, or player choice)
  - Custom onboarding for advanced or returning players
  - Integration with lore events and dynamic campaign phases
- Future expansions may include:
  - Alternate starting locations (e.g., clan base, arcology, wormhole ruins)
  - Faction-specific tutorials
  - Event-driven intros (e.g., contested array, Beachhead rush)

## Player Onboarding Flow
1. **Account Setup**
   - Player creates an account.
   - Under the account, player creates a character.
   - Character name is generated using a multi-language system (inspired by Dwarf Fortress fortress naming):
     - Player chooses a name in their language (e.g., "The Black Blade of Doom").
     - Name is parsed and translated into the selected ethnic group's native language (e.g., Uthank Madulri).
     - Character has alternate names in other languages (e.g., Greyspeak: Uthank Madulri, Bluespeak: Kovo Acktu).

2. **Clan Hall Placement**
   - Player is placed in their clan hall upon character creation.
   - Clan Halls are hosted in the Imperial Eye system of each territory, located on a dedicated space station with 31 offices—one for each chartered clan.
   - Player can view available contracts and missions.

3. **Campaign Selection**
   - Player browses active campaigns (with start/end dates).
   - Player reviews available Open Contracts for each campaign.

4. **Starter Ship & Arrival**
   - Player boards their starter ship.
   - Arrives at the Imperial Eye or their patron's homeworld.

5. **Tutorial Missions**
   - Player is guided through a series of tutorial missions.
   - Missions introduce meeting NPCs, contract acceptance/rejection, and basic gameplay.
   - Example tutorial: manufacture a toy and deliver it to an imperial station.

6. **Contract & Mission System**
   - All quests are presented as contracts to perform tasks.
   - Contracts are categorized by the three-tier approach:
     - **Tier 1:** Single player contracts
     - **Tier 2:** Group/squad/clan contracts
     - **Tier 3:** House-level contracts
   - Contracts also have a difficulty tier, randomly assigned from 1 to 5, to indicate challenge and reward level.
   - Rewards for contracts scale with the player's standing with corporations, agents, and NPCs—the higher the reputation, the better the rewards offered.
   - If a contract remains unaccepted for a period, the provider will progressively sweeten the deal, increasing rewards until someone accepts.
   - The types of contracts available to a player may be gatekept based on their standing; higher reputation unlocks more lucrative or sensitive contracts.
   - Political motivations may lead providers to offer tainted or sabotaged contracts, aiming to undermine a player's progress or reputation. Players must weigh risks—sometimes a deal that seems too good to be true is a trap, and clever players may even trick rivals into accepting such contracts.
   - Content additions should always consider offering contracts for all three tiers and a range of difficulties.

## Game Philosophy
- The game philosophy is "what happens in game, stays in game." Players are encouraged to use in-game mechanics for espionage, sabotage, and intrigue—external coordination or metagaming is discouraged.
- The engine will provide tools for forged transponders, theft, trap-laying, and other forms of in-game deception. Tutorials should include examples and guidance on these mechanics, teaching players both how to lay traps and how to avoid them.

## Success Criteria
- Players understand basic controls, systems, and lore context
- Players complete initial missions and contracts
- Players are equipped to make meaningful choices about faction, contract, and exploration
- Feedback is collected to improve onboarding and tutorial content
