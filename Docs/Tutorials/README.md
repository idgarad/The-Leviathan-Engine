## 🛡️ Scope Management

### Current Sprint Focus
**Sprint**: [To be updated as we progress]
**Learning Objectives**: [Current focus areas]
**Scope Boundaries**: [What we're NOT doing this sprint]

### Scope Creep Warning Signs
- "This would be cool to add..."
- "Since we're already here, let's also..."
- "This is more complex than expected, but..."
- "We should probably handle edge case X..."

### Success Criteria
Each sprint has explicit "done" criteria. **Good enough is perfect** for learning progression.

## 🎓 Meta-Learning Notes

This tutorial series is being developed **iteratively** as the primary learner (Idgarad) progresses through the material. This means:

1. **Real-world adjustments** are captured and incorporated
2. **Scope creep lessons** are documented for future learners
3. **Resource recommendations** are tested and validated
4. **Pacing insights** reflect actual learning experience

The goal is to create the definitive "zero to Rust game engine developer" tutorial series.
