Done. The **Wormhole Codex** is now finalized and ready for integration into your broader lore and system documentation.

# ✅ Finalized Wormhole Codex

## 🌀 1. Overview

Wormholes are transient anomalies that appear randomly in conventional space, granting temporary access to **Nexus-Space** — a sealed, fragmented subdomain of solar systems. These wormholes are unpredictable, mass-limited, and central to exploration, cult phenomena, and pirate escalation.

---

## 🌌 2. Wormhole Attributes

| Attribute        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Size**         | Small, Medium, Large — governs transit capacity and visibility |
| **Duration**     | Short, Medium, Long — determines how long the wormhole remains active |
| **Mass Limit**   | Finite threshold; exceeding it destabilizes the wormhole |
| **Connection Type** | C2W (Conventional → Nexus), W2W (Nexus → Nexus), C2C (Conventional → Conventional), W2C (Nexus → Conventional) |

---

## 🧭 3. Nexus-Space

- Each campaign has a **fixed Nexus map** (~1/5th the size of the main campaign)
- Solar systems are static, but **gate connectivity shifts dynamically**
- Gates are **pre-built**, made of **organic rock**, and cannot be replicated
- Some systems become **dead ends**, others **transit hubs**, depending on gate shifts

---

## 🛰️ 4. Scanner Arrays

- Orbital structures that provide **live gate topology** for their host system
- Without them, systems are **dark** — no visibility into gate shifts
- Destroying Scanner Arrays is a **tactical option** to blind enemies or hide movement

---

## 🧬 5. Cult Influence

- Cult activity **increases wormhole emergence probability**
- May alter gate behavior, extend durations, or trigger exotic effects
- Some cults believe Nexus-Space is a **primordial realm** or **divine construct**

---

## 🏴‍☠️ 6. Pirate Genesis Protocol

- Pirates begin **embedded in conventional space**, smuggled in or bribed aboard
- They **bootstrap infrastructure**, then gain access to Nexus-Space
- Use Nexus-Space to **link up**, build hidden bases, and launch **raids**
- Raids emerge from W2C gates, often targeting strategic or vulnerable locations

---

## 🧠 7. Strategic Implications

- Wormholes offer **temporary shortcuts**, **hidden staging grounds**, and **ambush vectors**
- Nexus-Space is a **Dark Forest**: visibility invites danger, silence ensures survival
- Scanner control, cult monitoring, and pirate suppression are key to long-term survival

## 📘 8. Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Nexus-Space** | A fragmented subdomain accessed via wormholes; origin unknown |

| **W2W** | Nexus-Space to Nexus-Space |
| **C2C** | Conventional to Conventional |
| **W2C** | Nexus-Space to Conventional space |
| **Mass Limit** | Maximum cumulative mass that can pass through a wormhole before destabilization |
| **Scanner Array** | Orbital structure that reveals gate topology in a Nexus system |
| **Cult Influence** | Mechanic where cult activity affects wormhole behavior |
| **Dark Forest** | Strategic doctrine where visibility invites danger; silence is survival |
