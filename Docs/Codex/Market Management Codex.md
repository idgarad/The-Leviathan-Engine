# 📜 Codex of Market Management

## 🌌 Lore Layer

- **Markets as Imperial Arteries**: In the Leviathan Engine, markets are the pulsing veins of interstellar society, where credits flow like blood through the body of the Empire. They enforce the Sacred Rule through contracts, reputation, and Imperial oversight, while allowing factions to wage economic wars without open violence.
- **Factional Dynamics**: Houses control regional economies, imposing tariffs and embargoes, while corporations offer neutral alternatives. Players navigate this web of trust and treachery, using espionage to manipulate fees and forge deals.
- **Emergent Intrigue**: Contracts are not just transactions—they are signals of intent, leaking strategic secrets that fuel the game's narrative of ambition and betrayal.

## ⚙️ Market Mechanics

### 1. Core Principles

- **Fresh Campaign, Persistent Factions:**  
  - Each campaign begins with a reset economy.  
  - Factions, corporations, and players retain persistent assets, skills, and incomes.  
- **Faucets & Sinks:**  
  - **Faucets** inject credits, goods, and materials (production, contracts, events).  
  - **Sinks** remove them (maintenance, tariffs, consumption, corruption).  
- **Localized Economies:**  
  - Each House, station, and free port maintains its own market ledger.  
  - Arbitrage and station trading emerge naturally from regional price differences.  
- **Standing & Access:**  
  - Market access is gated by faction reputation.  
  - Angering a House or Corporation risks embargo or denial of docking rights.  
- **Neutral Hubs:**  
  - The Imperial Eye system functions as a free port with universal access.  
- **Corporations as Flex Points:**  
  - Neutral, cross‑territory contracts.  
  - Attractive for late‑game free traders seeking independence.

### 2. Market Topology

- **Global Monitor:** Oversees inflation, liquidity, systemic shocks.  
- **Regional Markets:** House economies with tariffs, embargoes, and factional flavor.  
- **Station Markets:** Localized order books with inventory, fees, and reputation gates.  
- **Free Ports:** Neutral, high‑volume, low‑restriction hubs.  
- **Black Markets:** Hidden order books for contraband, embargoed goods, and forged deals.

### 3. Trade Mechanism: Commodities Order Book

- **Buy/Sell Orders:** Posted by NPCs, players, factions.  
- **Matching Engine:** Orders execute when buy ≥ sell price; partial fills allowed.  
- **Taxes & Fees:**  
  - Imperial tax, House tariffs, Steward levies, local station fees, facility surcharges.  
- **Private Contracts:**  
  - Direct agreements outside the order book.  
  - Faster, riskier, potentially illegal.

### 4. Underwriting & Contract Enforcement

- **Underwriters:** Corporations (and sometimes the USO) guarantee contracts.  
- **Imperial Enforcement:** Ensures contracts are honored, except underworld deals.  
- **Standing Benefits:**  
  - Lower fees, higher contract limits, faster enforcement.  
  - Some factions only accept contracts with trusted underwriters.  
- **Forgery Resistance:**  
  - High standing makes forged contracts less believable.  
  - Low standing makes actors easier to frame.  

---

### 5. Reputation as Currency

- **Pledging:** Contracts require standing pledges.  
- **Resolution:**  
  - Success → pledge refunded, possible bonus.  
  - Failure → pledge lost, bridges burned.  
- **Layered Contracts:**  
  - Multiple contracts (mining + defense + logistics) can be stacked.  
  - More secure, but more complex and costly.  

---

### 6. Escrow Services

- **Neutral Trust:** Corporations and Imperial banks hold assets in trust.  
- **Workflow:** Deposit → Verification → Execution → Release/Return.  
- **Types:**  
  - Imperial (high trust, high fee).  
  - Corporate (flexible, mid‑fee).  
  - House (biased).  
  - Underworld (no Imperial enforcement).  
- **Espionage Surface:** Fees can be skimmed or embezzled, but assets remain secure.  

---

### 7. Fee Manipulation & Embezzlement

- **Attack Surface:** Taxes, tariffs, escrow fees.  
- **Espionage Actions:**  
  - Skimming (low risk, low reward).  
  - Embezzlement (high risk, high reward).  
  - Forgery (frame another faction).  
- **Suspicion:**  
  - If anomalies detected, suspicion falls on both contract parties.  
  - Market Monitor audits fee flows.  

---

### 8. Contract Intelligence

- **Metadata as Signal:**  
  - Volume, counterparties, underwriters, escrow usage.  
  - Surges in contracts reveal strategic intent (e.g., shipbuilding = war prep).  
- **Espionage Actions:**  
  - Surveillance, metadata interception, pattern analysis, leaks, false signals.  
- **Counter‑Measures:**  
  - Dummy contracts, layered underwriters, fragmented deals.  
- **Imperial Contracts:**  
  - Even Throne projects (e.g., star arrays) can leak strategic intent.  

---

### 9. Emergent Play

- **Station Trading:** Arbitrage between localized markets.  
- **Factional Politics:** Reputation gates access; embargoes force smugglers into black markets.  
- **Corporate Neutrality:** Late‑game strategy for free traders.  
- **Espionage Depth:** Fee theft, forged deals, and metadata leaks create intrigue.  
- **Reputation Economy:** Standing is both a currency and a shield.  
- **Escrow & Trust:** Large‑scale deals require neutral intermediaries.  
- **Signals & Deception:** Contracts themselves become intelligence assets.

## 🔗 Integration with Other Codices

- **Sovereignty & Territory**: Economic levers like tariffs and embargoes tie into territorial control.  
- **Psychology of Play**: Reputation and trust mechanics enforce player wellness safeguards.
