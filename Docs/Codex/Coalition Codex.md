# 🛡️ Coalition Codex

## 1. Definition

A **Coalition** is a self-contracted alliance of **Wardens** who serve under the same House. Unlike formal Clans, coalitions are **temporary, player-formed units** designed for tactical coordination, shared objectives, and social cohesion during a campaign.

> “A Coalition is not a command — it is a pact. A promise made between Wardens, and to the House.”

---

## 2. Formation & Legitimacy

- A Coalition is **not considered formed** until it **signs a formal contract** with the House
- All members must be **active Wardens** of the same House at the time of signing
- The contract defines:
  - Shared objectives
  - Operational scope
  - Duration of service
- Coalitions without a House contract are **invalid and non-operational**

---

## 3. The Prizett Clause

- If a Warden’s personal service contract with the House expires **before** the Coalition’s contract ends, they may request a **Prizett**
- A **Prizett** is an **Imperial-era legal extension**, allowing the Warden to remain in service **for the duration of the Coalition’s contract**
- Prizetts are **granted at House discretion**, often based on merit, loyalty, or strategic necessity

---

## 4. Gameplay Functions

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Shared Intel** | Coalition members can share Scanner data, gate topology, and pirate sightings |
| **Tactical Comms** | Dedicated channels for coordination and strategic planning |
| **Resource Pooling** | Informal logistics sharing and mutual defense |
| **Coalition Tag** | Optional visual identifier (e.g., `[VIREX-STRIKE]`) for UI and comms |
| **Contract Binding** | Coalition signs a House contract as a unit, gaining shared objectives and rewards |

---

## 5. Strategic Role

- Coalitions allow Houses to **scale operations** without rigid hierarchy
- Enable **expeditionary forces**, **Nexus incursions**, **Scanner defense rings**, or **cult suppression teams**
- Serve as **onboarding structures** for new players or **elite strike teams** for veterans

---

## 6. Political Risk and Clan Tensions

- Members may belong to **different Clans**, each with its own doctrine and priorities
- Coalition actions that conflict with Clan interests can lead to:
  - **Strained relations**
  - **Diplomatic fallout**
  - **Disciplinary action**, including expulsion

> “The raid on Califos Gate was a tactical success — and a political disaster. Three Clans withdrew support. One expelled its Warden.”

---

## 7. Diplomatic Potential

- Coalitions can also **build bridges** between Clans
- When led by influential Wardens, they may:
  - Broker informal alliances
  - Demonstrate shared strategic value
  - Influence House policy from the ground up

> “The Coalition of the Hollow Spire included Wardens from five rival Clans. By campaign’s end, they were speaking with one voice.”

---

## 8. NPC Staffing and Espionage Exposure

- Coalitions must be **staffed by NPCs** in key operational roles:
  - Logistics
  - Intel
  - Scanner management
  - Contract enforcement
- These NPCs are **targetable** by espionage systems:
  - Bribery, sabotage, data leaks
- Coalitions must invest in **counterintelligence** and **loyalty audits** to remain secure

> “We thought the gate collapse was random. Then we found the Coalition’s Nexus Cartographer had been compromised.”

---

## 9. Corporate Contracts and Doctrine Services

Coalitions may enter formal contracts with **corporations** to access specialized services:

### 🛠️ Ship Doctrine Services

- Corporations provide **pre-fitted ships** aligned with Coalition-approved doctrines
- Ships are drawn from **corporate stockpiles**, distributed by NPC logistics officers
- Coalition members may **check out** doctrine ships for active operations

### 🔁 Ship Replacement Service

- Lost doctrine ships may be **replaced** from existing stockpiles
- Replacement eligibility depends on:
  - Contract terms
  - Stockpile availability
  - Battle report verification

> “We lost the entire vanguard at the Maw Gate. By morning, the replacement fleet was waiting — same fits, same firepower.”
