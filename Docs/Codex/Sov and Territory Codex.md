# 📘 Sovereignty & Territory Codex (Final)

## 🌌 Lore Layer
- **Imperial Mandate**  
  - All space belongs to the Empire. Houses, Corporations, and Clans do not own territory outright—they hold it in **fiefdom** or **charter**, granted by Imperial authority.  
  - Campaigns are the Empire’s mechanism for expanding into new **Territories** within larger **Sectors** of the galaxy.  

- **Sectors & Territories**  
  - **Sectors** are lore containers: each Sector may host multiple campaigns over time, each with unique rules and conditions.  
  - **Territories** are the specific star clusters (3,000–8,000 systems) contested during a campaign.  
  - Once a campaign concludes, the Territory is considered “settled” and is normally not revisited in gameplay, but it remains in the lore.  

- **Seasonal Content**  
  - Each campaign represents a **season of conquest and infrastructure‑building**: Houses and Wardens focus on claiming systems and constructing the planetary and orbital foundations (colony capacity) needed for future settlement.  
  - If Houses perform well, they may retain holdings as permanent **fiefdoms** when the Territory is absorbed into the Empire.  
  - Poor performance means losing claims, with the Empire redistributing systems to more loyal or effective Houses.

## ⚔️ Sovereignty Mechanics
- **Layers of Control**  
  1. **Imperial Sovereignty**: The Empire is the ultimate owner of all space.  
  2. **House Stewardship**: Houses are granted Arrays (clusters of systems) to manage.  
  3. **Governor Authority**: Governors administer individual systems within an Array.  
  4. **Warden Presence**: Wardens enforce sovereignty through fleets, industry, and contracts.  

- **Contesting Territory**  
  - The Empire may declare Arrays or systems “contested,” opening them to conquest.  
  - Sovereignty requires **continuous Warden presence**—fleets, industry, or infrastructure.  
  - Inactivity leads to decay, reverting systems to contested status.  

- **Campaign Outcomes**  
  - **Retention**: Houses that perform well retain holdings as permanent fiefdoms.  
  - **Redistribution**: Underperforming Houses lose claims; the Empire reallocates systems.  
  - **Imperial Favor**: Exceptional loyalty or service may earn Houses additional holdings.

## 🔄 Economic Reset & Imperial Eye Stargates
 - **Initial ISC Stargates**  
   - At campaign start, the **Imperial Survey Corps (ISC)** provides temporary stargates with **very low mass throughput**.  
   - In parallel, Imperial Survey & Development (ISD) teams prioritize installing localized infrastructure such as assembly yards, stabilizers, and **temporal accelerators** on key world candidates. These accelerators compress local construction time for planetary facilities (subject to energy, stabilizer capacity, and ISD certification), enabling faster ramp‑up of **colony capacity** even while interstellar throughput is limited.  
   - Because gates and accelerators are constrained, Houses and Corporations must bootstrap the economy with local resources while coordinating ISD priorities.  

- **Bootstrapping Phase**  
  - Wardens must establish mining, refining, and manufacturing chains within the Territory.  
  - Early scarcity drives conflict, smuggling, and opportunism.  

- **Imperial Expectation**  
  - The Throne expects Houses and Corporations to **develop the Territory** while the ISC constructs the permanent **Imperial Eye Stargate**.  
  - This is both a test of loyalty and a practical necessity.  

- **Campaign Conclusion**  
  - When the **Imperial Eye Stargate** is completed, the Territory is fully integrated into the Empire.  
  - The campaign ends, sovereignty outcomes are locked, and the economy resets for the next expansion.

## 🛡️ Player Sovereignty by Proxy
- **NPC Sovereignty at the Top**  
  - Sovereignty is always vested in NPC organizations: the Empire, Houses, and Corporations.  
  - Players cannot claim sovereignty directly; they act as **proxies** through contracts and missions.  

- **Ad Hoc Houses**  
  - Large clans or alliances working under a House’s service may function as **informal, lesser Houses** (term TBD).  
  - These groups can be granted governorships or contracts but remain under the umbrella of a greater NPC House.  

- **Shares & Dividends**  
  - Completing contracts (e.g., building a stargate) issues **shares** to participants.  
  - Shares pay **dividends** until a specified term, which may span multiple campaigns.  
  - Even if sovereignty changes, the **Imperial Throne guarantees payouts**.  
  - Shares may be tapped for fines, insurance, or fees without flooding new economies with capital.  

- **Example**  
  - House Bakken is granted the NX2113O‑X Array, renaming it the **Mercedes Array**.  
  - The **Langer Coalition** (9 Wardens) govern the system XN‑012AV, naming it **The Blue Cradle System**.  
  - They build its stargate, earning shares.  
  - Two months later, House Dremer takes the Array. The Langer Coalition loses governorship but continues to receive dividends from their shares.

## ♾️ Persistence Layer
- **Permanent Presence**  
  - Concluded Territories remain in lore, providing **ongoing income, bonuses, and prestige** to their controlling factions.  
- **Narrative Continuity**  
  - Political outcomes, clan reputations, and House histories persist across campaigns.  
- **Parallel Campaigns**  
  - Multiple campaigns may run simultaneously in different Sectors.  
  - Players may commit to one campaign at a time, ensuring narrative weight.

## 🏛️ Legacy Metadata & Political Memory
- **Permanent Records**  
  - Every contract, construction, and governorship is logged in Imperial archives.  
  - Names of clans, Wardens, and Houses are etched into the metadata of stargates, stations, and systems.  

- **Naming Rights**  
  - Names given to Arrays and systems persist, even if sovereignty changes.  
  - Imperial law forbids erasure without sanction.  

- **Political Consequences**  
  - Rival Houses may inherit fiefdoms littered with reminders of their enemies’ past triumphs.  
  - This fuels **long‑term grudges** and bitter rivalries.  
  - Shares and metadata force current rulers to pay tribute to rivals, deepening resentment.

## 📚 Lore Hooks
- **“Governorship is fleeting, but the archives are eternal.”**  
- **The Mocking Gate**: A stargate built by a rival clan, still bearing their crest, now sits at the heart of a House’s fiefdom.  
- **The Bitter Array**: An Array whose metadata is dominated by a rival House’s legacy, sparking centuries of resentment.  
- **Clan Pride**: Clans boast of their names etched into Imperial records, even if they no longer hold the territory.
