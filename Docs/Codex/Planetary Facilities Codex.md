Here’s a **formalized Planetary Facilities Codex** that captures the Factorio‑meets‑SimCity loop you described, with clear rules, incentives, and integration into the larger simulation. This sits alongside your Cargo, Sovereignty, and NPC codices as a core pillar.

# 🏗️ Planetary Facilities Codex

## 1. Foundational Premise
- **Pre‑Colonial Era:** Planets are not yet actively colonized by people. Instead, the Imperial Survey & Development (ISD) and automated systems build the foundational infrastructure — factories, orbital constructors, energy grids, and specialized **temporal accelerators** — that prepare planets to receive colonists in the future.
- **Player Role:** You act as both a **developer** (fulfilling contracts for factions/Imperial oversight) and a **shadow warden** (skimming resources for personal or factional advantage). Your work increases the planet's **colony capacity** (infrastructure readiness), not an immediate colonist population.
- **Gameplay Loop:** Factorio‑style production chains + SimCity‑style infrastructure planning, with tension between **compliance** and **exploitation**, amplified by the presence and management of temporal accelerators.

## 2. Facility Types

| Facility Class | Function | Contract Role | Exploitation Hook |
|----------------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Terraform Prep Units** | Atmosphere scrubbers, soil processors | Required for habitable colony rating | Divert rare gases or isotopes |
| **Orbital Constructors** | Build stations, shipyards, defenses | Fulfill military/sovereignty contracts | Skim alloys for private fleets |
| **Resource Extractors** | Automated mines, refineries | Deliver raw/processed materials | Funnel excess into black markets |
| **Power Grids** | Fusion, solar, geothermal | Maintain contract uptime | Overbuild for hidden capacity |
| **Habitation Scaffolds** | Empty domes, life‑support shells | Required before colonists arrive | Rent “ghost housing” to smugglers |
| **Cultural Seeds (Vaults)** | Data Vaults, archives, training sims | Imperial requirement for colonist prep | Alter or duplicate Vaults for advantage |

## 3. Timeframe & Pacing
- **Space Construction:** Fast (stations in ~48 hours real time).  
- **Planetary Facilities (base):** Slower (weeks/months of campaign time) when built without temporal assistance.  
- **Temporal Accelerators:** ISD‑deployed accelerators are specialized infrastructure that, once installed and powered, provide localized construction time compression for planetary facilities and assembly work. With an active accelerator, specific production and assembly tasks on the planet can run at accelerated rates (configurable by campaign tuning), reducing the effective calendar time needed to reach a target **colony capacity**.
- **Diegetic Justification:** Atmosphere, geology, and biosphere complexity still constrain some processes, but temporal accelerators allow the Empire and Houses to prepare planets rapidly for later colonization without immediately moving people in.

## 4. Contracts & Obligations
- **Imperial Contracts:**  
  - Define quotas (X tons of ore, Y habitation domes, Z Vaults).  
  - Provide steady income, reputation, and political capital.  
- **Failure:**  
  - Damages faction standing.  
  - May trigger audits, sanctions, or eviction.  
- **Over‑Fulfillment:**  
  - Grants bonuses, but risks exposing skimming.  

---

## 5. Skimming & Exploitation
- **Excess Resources:** Diverted into hidden caches, smuggling routes, or personal projects.  
- **Risk:**  
  - Audits may detect discrepancies.  
  - Rival factions may sabotage or expose you.  
- **Reward:**  
  - Black‑market profits.  
  - Strategic leverage (hidden stockpiles, secret defenses).  

- **Temporal Accelerator Risks & Management:** Temporal accelerators require large initial energy investments, certified stabilizers, and ISD oversight. Unauthorized overdrive or illicit sync‑links can produce localized anomalies, reduce production quality, or trigger Imperial audits and sanctions. Wardens contracted to operate or guard accelerators gain lucrative contracts but also elevated political risk.

## 6. Integration with Other Codices
- **Cargo Codex:** All planetary output measured in Cs, must be containerized and shipped. Storage bottlenecks matter.  
- **Sovereignty Codex:** Control of planetary facilities = leverage in sovereignty wars. Contracts and liabilities transfer with sovereignty.  
- **NPC Codex:** Rival AI factions may sabotage, infiltrate, or compete for contracts.  
- **Imperial Eye Transition:** When activated, facilities flip into true colonies. Pre‑Eye decisions (contracts honored, resources skimmed, infrastructure built) shape the colony’s starting conditions.  

---

## 7. Gameplay Loops
- **Optimization Puzzle:** Maximize throughput while meeting quotas.  
- **Moral Dilemma:** Balance contract compliance with personal gain.  
- **Strategic Choice:** Invest in planetary prep (long‑term) vs. orbital stations (short‑term).  
- **Narrative Payoff:** Colonists inherit the world you shaped—prosperous, corrupt, fragile, or fortified.  

---

## 8. Factional Flavor
- **Corporates:** Ruthless efficiency, high risk of over‑exploitation.  
- **Houses:** Prestige projects, slower but resilient.  
- **Wardens:** Thrive on skimming, sabotage, and black‑market exports.  
- **Imperials:** Audit and enforce compliance, but can be bribed or misled.  

---

## 9. Codex Summary
- **Planetary Facilities = Pre‑Colonial Scaffolds.**  
- **Player Role = Developer + Exploiter.**  
- **Contracts = Obligations with political weight.**  
- **Skimming = Risk/reward loop.**  
- **Integration = Cargo, Sovereignty, NPCs, Imperial Eye.**  
- **Pacing = Slow planetary prep vs. fast orbital builds.**

✅ This codex makes planetary facilities a **distinct, engaging subsystem**: slower, riskier, and more strategic than space construction, but with huge long‑term payoff when colonists finally arrive.  

Would you like me to **expand this into a ruleset for the “Skimming Game”**—with detection mechanics, audit cycles, and factional consequences—so players have a clear framework for how much they can push their luck before getting caught?
