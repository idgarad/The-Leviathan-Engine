Here’s a **formalized Planetary Facilities Codex** that captures the Factorio‑meets‑SimCity loop you described, with clear rules, incentives, and integration into the larger simulation. This sits alongside your Cargo, Sovereignty, and NPC codices as a core pillar.

# 🏗️ Planetary Facilities Codex

---

## 1. Foundational Premise
- **Pre‑Colonial Era:** Planets are not yet inhabited by colonists. Instead, they host **AI‑driven nanite and robotic facilities** preparing infrastructure.  
- **Player Role:** You act as both a **developer** (fulfilling contracts for factions/Imperial oversight) and a **shadow warden** (skimming resources for personal or factional advantage).  
- **Gameplay Loop:** Factorio‑style production chains + SimCity‑style infrastructure planning, with tension between **compliance** and **exploitation**.  

---

## 2. Facility Types

| Facility Class | Function | Contract Role | Exploitation Hook |
|----------------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Terraform Prep Units** | Atmosphere scrubbers, soil processors | Required for habitable colony rating | Divert rare gases or isotopes |
| **Orbital Constructors** | Build stations, shipyards, defenses | Fulfill military/sovereignty contracts | Skim alloys for private fleets |
| **Resource Extractors** | Automated mines, refineries | Deliver raw/processed materials | Funnel excess into black markets |
| **Power Grids** | Fusion, solar, geothermal | Maintain contract uptime | Overbuild for hidden capacity |
| **Habitation Scaffolds** | Empty domes, life‑support shells | Required before colonists arrive | Rent “ghost housing” to smugglers |
| **Cultural Seeds (Vaults)** | Data Vaults, archives, training sims | Imperial requirement for colonist prep | Alter or duplicate Vaults for advantage |

---

## 3. Timeframe & Pacing
- **Space Construction:** Fast (stations in ~48 hours real time).  
- **Planetary Facilities:** Slower (weeks/months of campaign time).  
- **Diegetic Justification:** Atmosphere, geology, and biosphere complexity slow planetary prep, while vacuum + forcefields accelerate orbital builds.  

---

## 4. Contracts & Obligations
- **Imperial Contracts:**  
  - Define quotas (X tons of ore, Y habitation domes, Z Vaults).  
  - Provide steady income, reputation, and political capital.  
- **Failure:**  
  - Damages faction standing.  
  - May trigger audits, sanctions, or eviction.  
- **Over‑Fulfillment:**  
  - Grants bonuses, but risks exposing skimming.  

---

## 5. Skimming & Exploitation
- **Excess Resources:** Diverted into hidden caches, smuggling routes, or personal projects.  
- **Risk:**  
  - Audits may detect discrepancies.  
  - Rival factions may sabotage or expose you.  
- **Reward:**  
  - Black‑market profits.  
  - Strategic leverage (hidden stockpiles, secret defenses).  

---

## 6. Integration with Other Codices
- **Cargo Codex:** All planetary output measured in Cs, must be containerized and shipped. Storage bottlenecks matter.  
- **Sovereignty Codex:** Control of planetary facilities = leverage in sovereignty wars. Contracts and liabilities transfer with sovereignty.  
- **NPC Codex:** Rival AI factions may sabotage, infiltrate, or compete for contracts.  
- **Imperial Eye Transition:** When activated, facilities flip into true colonies. Pre‑Eye decisions (contracts honored, resources skimmed, infrastructure built) shape the colony’s starting conditions.  

---

## 7. Gameplay Loops
- **Optimization Puzzle:** Maximize throughput while meeting quotas.  
- **Moral Dilemma:** Balance contract compliance with personal gain.  
- **Strategic Choice:** Invest in planetary prep (long‑term) vs. orbital stations (short‑term).  
- **Narrative Payoff:** Colonists inherit the world you shaped—prosperous, corrupt, fragile, or fortified.  

---

## 8. Factional Flavor
- **Corporates:** Ruthless efficiency, high risk of over‑exploitation.  
- **Houses:** Prestige projects, slower but resilient.  
- **Wardens:** Thrive on skimming, sabotage, and black‑market exports.  
- **Imperials:** Audit and enforce compliance, but can be bribed or misled.  

---

## 9. Codex Summary
- **Planetary Facilities = Pre‑Colonial Scaffolds.**  
- **Player Role = Developer + Exploiter.**  
- **Contracts = Obligations with political weight.**  
- **Skimming = Risk/reward loop.**  
- **Integration = Cargo, Sovereignty, NPCs, Imperial Eye.**  
- **Pacing = Slow planetary prep vs. fast orbital builds.**

✅ This codex makes planetary facilities a **distinct, engaging subsystem**: slower, riskier, and more strategic than space construction, but with huge long‑term payoff when colonists finally arrive.  

Would you like me to **expand this into a ruleset for the “Skimming Game”**—with detection mechanics, audit cycles, and factional consequences—so players have a clear framework for how much they can push their luck before getting caught?
