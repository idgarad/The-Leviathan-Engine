\*\*Guiding codex development\*\*



I need to follow the developer's instructions here. The goal is to create an amended codex with a very general single-line prompt — not focused on specific subjects, just emphasizing things like lines and shading. It should follow formatting rules like H3+ headings, avoid mention of the system, and keep it short. I'll focus on things like black line art, cross-contour hatching, and ambient occlusion while keeping it neutral. Alright, let's craft that!

\### Default Art Style Codex — Mythic Cyberpunk Vanguard



\#### Focused generation prompt (short)

Cinematic, line-driven sci‑fi style with decisive black line art, three-tier line weight, layered cross-contour hatching, and structured soft-to-hard shading; narrow cool rim light paired with a broad warm fill; strong silhouette emphasis and painterly high-detail textures.

\### Plain-language summary

This codex defines a rendering grammar where disciplined linework and a clear shading system create engineered, readable forms. Line hierarchy, cross-contour strokes, and measured hatching communicate surface curvature and materiality. Shading is plane-based—block core shadow, midtone, and highlight—refined with layered hatching so metals read crisp and specular while fabrics remain soft. Color and subject can vary; the identifying signature is the line-and-shade language that makes designs feel precise, tactile, and cinematic.

\### Line art rules (primary focus)

\- \*\*Line weight hierarchy:\*\* Use three core weights — thin for interior detail, medium for contours, thick for silhouettes and depth separation.  

\- \*\*Decisive strokes:\*\* Lines should feel confident and economical; avoid excessive sketchiness except for intentional texture.  

\- \*\*Cross-contour language:\*\* Use cross-contour hatching on curved surfaces and cylindrical forms to describe curvature and surface flow.  

\- \*\*Mechanical vs organic differentiation:\*\* Prefer crisp, slightly angular strokes for hard edges and joins; use softer, tapered strokes for cloth and organic forms.  

\- \*\*Silhouette clarity:\*\* Reinforce the outer silhouette with thicker outlines or deliberate shadow breaks to preserve immediate readability.  

\- \*\*Seams and panel logic:\*\* Draw seams, panel lines, and joins consistently with medium weight and add small bevel strokes where needed to imply chamfers.

\### Shading and rendering rules (primary focus)

\- \*\*Block tonal planes first:\*\* Establish core shadow, midtone, and key highlight before adding texture or detail.  

\- \*\*Layered hatching strategy:\*\* Model broad planes with parallel hatches; introduce cross-hatching at plane turns and occlusions; vary density to control value while keeping lines readable.  

\- \*\*Hard vs soft transitions:\*\* Render hard materials with sharp transitions and tight speculars; render soft materials with smoother gradients and softer edge halation.  

\- \*\*Rim and fill lighting:\*\* Use a narrow, crisp rim light to define edges and a broader, softer fill to model form; keep rim concentrated and fill diffuse.  

\- \*\*Ambient occlusion:\*\* Emphasize gaps, creases, and overlaps with concentrated hatching or flat darks to anchor parts spatially.  

\- \*\*Microtexture as final layer:\*\* Apply scratches, rivets, woven patterns, and surface grain with fine hatch or stipple after primary form and value are established.

\### Composition, pose, and detail language

\- \*\*Framing and silhouette:\*\* Favor compositions that allow a clean, dominant silhouette; backlighting or strong directional light helps separate foreground from background.  

\- \*\*Fidelity focus:\*\* Reserve highest line and shading fidelity for focal elements; simplify peripherals to avoid visual competition.  

\- \*\*Scale and overlap cues:\*\* Use overlapping elements and occlusion to convey scale while keeping the primary silhouette unambiguous.  

\- \*\*Rhythm and negative space:\*\* Maintain purposeful negative space around the primary subject to emphasize form and line clarity.

\### Quick codex brief (one paragraph)

Prioritize confident black line art with a three-tier weight system and cross-contour hatching to express curvature; block-in three tonal planes, then refine using layered parallel and cross hatching; render hard surfaces with tight specular highlights and sharp edges, soft surfaces with smooth gradients; apply a narrow cool rim and broad warm fill, increase ambient occlusion in creases, and add fine hatch/stipple microtexture last.

\### Single-line style prompt (subject-neutral)

Decisive black line art with three-tier weight; cross-contour and layered hatching to define curvature; block tonal planes then refine with parallel and cross hatching; clear hard-vs-soft shading language; narrow crisp rim light with broad soft fill; strong silhouette clarity; ambient occlusion and fine hatch microtexture.
