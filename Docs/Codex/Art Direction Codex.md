# 🎨 Art Direction Codex

## 🌌 Lore Layer

- **Visual Language of the Empire**: The art style embodies the Leviathan Engine's cyberpunk sci-fi aesthetic, where disciplined linework and structured shading evoke the precision of Imperial engineering and the tactile reality of spacefaring life. This codex ensures visual consistency across ships, stations, and characters, making the game's world feel engineered, cinematic, and immersive.

## ⚙️ Art Style Guidelines

### Focused Generation Prompt (Short)

Cinematic, line-driven sci-fi style with decisive black line art, three-tier line weight, layered cross-contour hatching, and structured soft-to-hard shading; narrow cool rim light paired with a broad warm fill; strong silhouette emphasis and painterly high-detail textures.

### Plain-Language Summary

This codex defines a rendering grammar where disciplined linework and a clear shading system create engineered, readable forms. Line hierarchy, cross-contour strokes, and measured hatching communicate surface curvature and materiality. Shading is plane-based—block core shadow, midtone, and highlight—refined with layered hatching so metals read crisp and specular while fabrics remain soft. Color and subject can vary; the identifying signature is the line-and-shade language that makes designs feel precise, tactile, and cinematic.

### Line Art Rules (Primary Focus)

- **Line Weight Hierarchy**: Use three core weights—thin for interior detail, medium for contours, thick for silhouettes and depth separation.
- **Decisive Strokes**: Lines should feel confident and economical; avoid excessive sketchiness except for intentional texture.
- **Cross-Contour Language**: Use cross-contour hatching on curved surfaces and cylindrical forms to describe curvature and surface flow.
- **Mechanical vs Organic Differentiation**: Prefer crisp, slightly angular strokes for hard edges and joins; use softer, tapered strokes for cloth and organic forms.
- **Silhouette Clarity**: Reinforce the outer silhouette with thicker outlines or deliberate shadow breaks to preserve immediate readability.
- **Seams and Panel Logic**: Draw seams, panel lines, and joins consistently with medium weight and add small bevel strokes where needed to imply chamfers.

### Shading and Rendering Rules (Primary Focus)

- **Block Tonal Planes First**: Establish core shadow, midtone, and key highlight before adding texture or detail.
- **Layered Hatching Strategy**: Model broad planes with parallel hatches; introduce cross-hatching at plane turns and occlusions; vary density to control value while keeping lines readable.
- **Hard vs Soft Transitions**: Render hard materials with sharp transitions and tight speculars; render soft materials with smoother gradients and softer edge halation.
- **Rim and Fill Lighting**: Use a narrow, crisp rim light to define edges and a broader, softer fill to model form; keep rim concentrated and fill diffuse.
- **Ambient Occlusion**: Emphasize gaps, creases, and overlaps with concentrated hatching or flat darks to anchor parts spatially.
- **Microtexture as Final Layer**: Apply scratches, rivets, woven patterns, and surface grain with fine hatch or stipple after primary form and value are established.

### Composition, Pose, and Detail Language

- **Framing and Silhouette**: Favor compositions that allow a clean, dominant silhouette; backlighting or strong directional light helps separate foreground from background.
- **Fidelity Focus**: Reserve highest line and shading fidelity for focal elements; simplify peripherals to avoid visual competition.
- **Scale and Overlap Cues**: Use overlapping elements and occlusion to convey scale while keeping the primary silhouette unambiguous.
- **Rhythm and Negative Space**: Maintain purposeful negative space around the primary subject to emphasize form and line clarity.

### Quick Codex Brief (One Paragraph)

Prioritize confident black line art with a three-tier weight system and cross-contour hatching to express curvature; block-in three tonal planes, then refine using layered parallel and cross hatching; render hard surfaces with tight specular highlights and sharp edges, soft surfaces with smooth gradients; apply a narrow cool rim and broad warm fill, increase ambient occlusion in creases, and add fine hatch/stipple microtexture last.

---

### Single-Line Style Prompt (Subject-Neutral)

Decisive black line art with three-tier weight; cross-contour and layered hatching to define curvature; block tonal planes then refine with parallel and cross hatching; clear hard-vs-soft shading language; narrow crisp rim light with broad soft fill; strong silhouette clarity; ambient occlusion and fine hatch microtexture.
