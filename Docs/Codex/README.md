## 🗂️ How to Use This Directory

- Each codex is a standalone reference. Start with the index above to find the system you want to learn about or modify.
- Codices are cross-referenced in documentation and gameplay systems. Use the codex titles for internal wiki links.
- For technical implementation, see coding examples in each codex (Python, Rust, C++).
- Lore hooks and design philosophy sections provide narrative context and rationale for mechanics.
- The directory is updated as new systems are added or existing ones are refined.
